# Project: Data Wrangling

In this project I am wrangling and visualizing data from @WeRateDogs Twitter-account.


## Questions

* What are the most common dog names?
* What tweets have the highest likes and retweets?
* What dog breeds are most favorited?
* What dog breeds have the highest level of confidence from the image prediction table?
* What dog breeds were predicted most often?


## Data

* @WeRateDogs Twitter-account
* Twitter interaction data from a Twitter API
* Image prediction data from Udacity

## Data Wrangling

I have gathered, assessed and cleaned the data to prepare it for further analysis.

## Data Visualization

I have made two visualizations that show what dog names are the most common and top-5 most favorited dog breeds.
